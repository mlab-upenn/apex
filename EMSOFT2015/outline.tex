\section{Outline}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Define scenarios, including initialization and exit conditions
	
	Running example
	
	\item Define handoff between scenarios, including how exiting one helps initialize the entering one
	
	\item Define HCHA for agents, and road 
	
	\item To concretize ideas, describe formally S1 with timed automaton and S2 with ODEs
	
	\item Previous was an example of an appealing case of scenario handoff: from model-checkable scenario to scenario requiring high-accuracy modeling
	
	\item Give 2,3 examples of driving missions requiring that
	
	\item Case study
	
	\item Conclusions and future work
