%\subsection{dReal Model}
%Consider several other vehicles in the environment with simple 2-D kinematics and the target vehicle with the nonlinear bicycle model dynamics. While in general the reachability problem for non-linear hybrid systems is undecidable. Recent work [1] has shown that if a user is able to specify a bound on the ODE which is an arbitrary positive rational number \(\delta\), then propositions in first order logic over a region \textit{unsafe} can be evaluated. Specifically a system, \(H\), is \(safe\) if it cannot reach \(unsafe\), and \(H\) is \(\delta-unsafe\) if \(H^d\) can reach \(unsafe\).

%\subsubsection{Vehicle Dynamics}
%Add in details about discretized forward dynamics and guards
%\subsubsection{Finite State Transition System}
%A finite transition system describing the passing manuever is given in UPPAAL (or NuSMV).Fig.\ref{fig:automaton} contains a a finite state automaton representing the scenario.
