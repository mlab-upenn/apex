\subsection{Environmental Vehicle Model}

\subsubsection{Vehicle Dynamics}
Environmental vehicle has simple 2D dynamics, no specific controller, non-determinism describes state evolution. When considering other agents (especially vehicles) in a scenario such non-linear dynamics are completely unnecessary. The primary reasoning is that the uncertainty about the state of other vehicles is not do to poor model parameter identification, but rather unknown inputs [2]. The dynamics of the other agents are described by equations (7) and (8) as in [3]:
\begin{equation}
\dot{s_x}=v\cos{\beta}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\dot{s_y}=v\sin{\beta}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Environment Assumptions}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Environmental vehicle must drive forwards.
	\item Environmental vehicle must not change lanes if other lane is occupied.
	\item At every step the environmental vehicle can apply +/- some specified level of acceleration.
	\item At every step environmental vehicle can switch lanes if condition 2 is not violated.
\end{enumerate}
