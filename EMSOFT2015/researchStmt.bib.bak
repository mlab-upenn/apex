abstract={Automatic generation of control programs that satisfy complex task specifications given in high-level specification languages such as temporal logics has been studied extensively. However, optimality of such control programs, for instance with respect to a cost function, has received relatively little attention. In this paper, we study the problem of optimal trajectory synthesis for a large class of specifications, given in the form of deterministic mu-calculus. We propose a sampling-based algorithm, based on the Rapidly-exploring Random Graphs (RRGs), that solves this problem with probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality guarantees. We evaluate our algorithm in a simulation studies involving a curvature constrained car. Our simulation results show that in this scenario the algorithm quickly discovers a trajectory that satisfies the specification, and improves this trajectory towards an optimal one if allowed more computation time. We also point out connections to (optimal) memoryless winning strategies in infinite parity games, which may be of independent interest.},

abstract={This paper considers the control of a linear plant when plant state information is being transmitted from a sensor to the controller over a wireless fading channel. The power allocated to these transmissions determines the probability of successful packet reception and is allowed to adapt online to both channel conditions and plant state. The goal is to design plant input and transmit power policies that minimize an infinite horizon cost combining power expenses and the conventional linear quadratic regulator control cost. Since plant inputs and transmit powers are in general coupled, a restricted information structure is imposed allowing them to be designed separately. Under this information structure the standard LQR controller becomes the optimal plant input policy, while the optimal communication policy follows a Markov decision process minimizing transmit power at the sensor and state estimation error at the controller. The optimal power adaptation to channel and plant states is examined qualitatively for general forward error correcting codes. In the particular case of capacity achieving codes event-triggered policies are recovered, where the sensor decides whether to transmit or not based on plant and channel conditions. Approximate dynamic programming is employed to derive a family of tractable suboptimal communication policies exhibiting the same qualitative features as the optimal one. The performance of our suboptimal policies is shown in simulations and is contrasted to other simple transmission policies.},

abstract={Today, large numbers of sensors and actuators embedded into innovative devices are being introduced into our connected world at an accelerating rate. This sensory swarm, or the swarm for short, presents an extension of the infosphere (today embodied in the cloud) into the physical world. The swarm gives the cloud eyes, ears, hands, and feet, enabling services that are directly embedded in the physical world rather than just in the cyber world. There is no question that the pervasive integration of smart, networked sensors and actuators into the physical world offers huge potential to address societal problems, to improve quality of life, and to smooth the boundaries between the human and the cyber worlds. But it comes with enormous challenges and risks-- both technical and non-technical. To mitigate these concerns, this paper proposes the adoption of open and universal platform to enable the simple, reliable, and secure deployment and operation of a multiplicity of distributed sense and control applications (which we call swarmlets). Providing access control and resource guarantees is essential to quality of experience and safety. Making the platform open and universal will unleash millions of swarm device and swarmlet developers, just as smart-phone platforms opened the door to millions of app developers.},

abstract={The paper proposes a control-theoretic framework for verification of numerical software systems, and puts forward software verification as an important application of control and systems theory. The idea is to transfer Lyapunov functions and the associated computational techniques from control systems analysis and convex optimization to verification of various software safety and performance specifications. These include but are not limited to absence of overflow, absence of division-by-zero, termination in finite time, absence of dead-code, and certain user-specified assertions. Central to this framework are Lyapunov invariants. These are properly constructed functions of the program variables, and satisfy certain properties-analogous to those of Lyapunov functions-along the execution trace. The search for the invariants can be formulated as a convex optimization problem. If the associated optimization problem is feasible, the result is a certificate for the specification.},

title={Power allocation schemes for pilot symbol assisted modulation over Rayleigh fading channels with no feedback}, 
year={2004}, 
month={June}, 
volume={2}, 
pages={737-741 Vol.2}, 
abstract={In communication over time-varying Rayleigh fading channels, adaptive coded modulation for pilot symbol assisted modulation (PSAM) without feedback has been shown to yield significant benefits in terms of achievable rates (M. Medard et al., 2000). This technique adapts transmission rate at the sender to the quality of the channel estimate at the receiver but keeps the mean power constant throughout. In this paper, we show that this adaptive PSAM scheme can be further improved if power and rate are jointly adapted to the quality of the measurement at the receiver. We study the optimal power distribution scheme and find it to apply the following principle: more power is allocated to symbols corresponding to better estimates at the receiver, while maintaining the average energy constraint satisfied within a period. We find that this simple scheme is optimal and performs better than adapting to channel quality using schemes akin to 'water filling'. Our model is a Rayleigh fading channel where time-variance is described by a Gauss-Markov model (M. Medard, 2000). The transmitter periodically sends pilot tones to measure the channel at the receiver. We interleave different codes, while maintaining the power constant over a codebook, and the average power over codebooks satisfying the constraint. Performance is quantified in terms of achievable rates. Our scheme does not require any real time computation or adaptation at the transmitter, and so comes at no extra cost with respect to (M. Meadard et al., 2000). When considering causal and non causal estimation strategies at the receiver, considerable improvement was attained without any added complexity.},

abstract={Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) specifications can capture complex state and timing requirements. Given a nonlinear dynamical system and an MTL specification for that system, our goal is to find a trajectory that violates or satisfies the specification. This trajectory can be used as a concrete feedback to the system designer in the case of violation or as a trajectory to be tracked in the case of satisfaction. The search for such a trajectory is conducted over the space of initial conditions, system parameters and input signals. We convert the trajectory search problem into an optimization problem through MTL robust semantics. Robustness quantifies how close the trajectory is to violating or satisfying a specification. Starting from some arbitrary initial condition and parameter and given an input signal, we compute a descent direction in the search space, which leads to a trajectory that optimizes the MTL robustness. This process can be iterated to reach local optima (min or max). We demonstrate the method on examples from the literature.},
