\section{Conclusions}
\label{conclusions}
{\it Autonomous plan verification presents two major challenges: a high level of unpredictability of the autonomous system's environment, and system execution that spans many levels of abstraction.}

{\it In this paper, we proposed a multi-formalism approach to verification to address these challenges, and illustrated it on a lane change scenario.}

{\it We also advocated a scenario verification framework.}

{\it In future work, we will automate the modeling and translation procedures, to allow the use of formal plan verification methods by control and system engineers.}

{\it We will also address the issue of prioritizing requirements in a given scenario to deal with emergencies.}
