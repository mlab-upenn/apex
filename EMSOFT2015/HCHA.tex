\subsection{Hierarchical communicating hybrid \\automata}
\label{HCHA}
Because autonomous systems are physical systems controlled by software, hybrid automata (HA) are a suitable formalism for modeling them.
Because the complexity of autonomous systems is significant, they are typically designed at multiple levels of abstraction, 
with different teams handling the design at different levels.
E.g. the mapping team might design the algorithm for finding the waypoints along a shortest route from start to end.
For this design, knowledge about, say, the powertrain control of the car is immaterial and abstracted away.
Indeed, details about the road itself are abstracted away as well.
Instead, it is represented as a directed graph.

The resulting system's description is given at multiple levels of abstraction (or multiple levels of detail). 
To model this situation, we adopt \emph{hierarchical} HA: each mode of the HA is itself an HA, down to some level.

Finally because these HHA, each representing an agent, are sensed by other agents in the scenario, we must model this sensing. 
We do so via the inputs to each HHA: given agent instance $a$, every other agent is associated with an input port on $a$.
When that other agent is within sensing distance of $a$, that input port is occupied by that agent's sensed information.
