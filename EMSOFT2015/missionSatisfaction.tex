\subsection{Completing a mission}
\label{missionSatisfaction}
What does it mean for an HCA to complete a mission?
It means that any trace of the HCA satisfies the \emph{sequence} of specifications presented by the scenarios in the mission.

\begin{thm}[Mission satisfaction]
	If Model M1 of concrete system Mc satisfies specs $\formula_1$ of scenario S1, and model M2 of Mc satisfies specs $\formula_2$ of scenario S2, and both M1 and M2 over-approximate Mc, 
	then any trace of Mc that goes through both scenarios in that order will satisfy the sequence of specs $\formula_1 \cdot \formula_2$.
	
	If a trace of M1 exits S1 without satisfying scenario goals $\formula_1$ (e.g. was interrupted by intersection), then what we can say depends on whether M2 is more or less abstract than M1.
	Suppose the trace goes from S1 to S2 to S1 again.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item if M2 is less abstract than M1, then by definition of abstraction its behavior can be mapped to a behavior of M1 since $L(M_1) \supset L(M_2)$. So I have a full trace of M1.
		\item if M2 is more abstract, tehn I can't do this mapping and I have a gap in the M1 execution: $x_1 in s1$, gap, $x_2 in s1$. 
		The verification then might give false positives because of gap.
		So if we get a counter-example in this case, must concretize gap  (refine M2) to see if cex is spurious or not.
	\end{itemize}
\end{thm}
