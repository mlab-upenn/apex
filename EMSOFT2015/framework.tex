\section{The modeling of autonomous plans}
\label{framework}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Scenarios and agents (don't dwell too long on this, just need to mention that we are verifying one scenario in this paper, but we have a plan for how this fits with overall mission verification)
	
	\item HCHA: because we need a representation rich enough to express on it different types of properties, which apply to different components of the complex autonomous vehicle
	
	\item Specification languages: should be suited to the verification goal. Here, reachability and LTL
	
\end{itemize}
