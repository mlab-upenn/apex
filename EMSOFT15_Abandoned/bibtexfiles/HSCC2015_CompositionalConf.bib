abstract = "Hybrid systems are systems that exhibit a combination of discrete and continuous behavior. Typical hybrid systems include computer components, which operate in discrete program steps, and real-world components, whose behavior over time intervals evolves according to physical constraints. Important examples of hybrid systems include automated transportation systems, robotics systems, process control systems, systems of embedded devices, and mobile computing systems. Such systems can be very complex, and very difficult to describe and analyze. This paper presents the Hybrid Input/Output Automaton (HIOA) modeling framework, a basic mathematical framework to support description and analysis of hybrid systems. An important feature of this model is its support for decomposing hybrid system descriptions. In particular, the framework includes a notion of external behavior for a hybrid I/O automaton, which captures its discrete and continuous interactions with its environment. The framework also defines what it means for one \{HIOA\} to implement another, based on an inclusion relationship between their external behavior sets, and defines a notion of simulation, which provides a sufficient condition for demonstrating implementation relationships. The framework also includes a composition operation for HIOAs, which respects the implementation relation and a notion of receptiveness, which implies that an \{HIOA\} does not block the passage of time. The framework is intended to support analysis methods from both computer science and control theory. This work is a simplification of our earlier \{HIOA\} model. The main simplification in the new model is a clearer separation between the mechanisms used to model discrete and continuous interaction between components. In particular, the new model removes the dual use of external variables for discrete and continuous interactions. "

abstract={Driven by the increase in complexity of design, time-to-market pressure and the need for a high level of collaboration between multiple discipline teams in a project, model based design has become the inevitable choice for IC Design projects. High-level models are being substantially used as the reference for implementation of the Register Transfer Level (RTL) counterpart of the designs. In that respect, Matlab/Simulink is one of the adopted high level modeling platforms in the IC design industry. However, checking the formal equivalence of the models with their RTL counterparts is still an area of interest to be investigated. In this study, a methodology addressing that matter is proposed. Simulink models of interest in this paper comprise built-in Simulink blocks, Stateflow blocks modeling the state machines, and user-defined blocks. Proposed methodology utilizes Simulink's Hardware Design Language (HDL) Coder and Real Time Workshop (RTW) tools, Mentor Graphics' Catapult, and Synopsys' Formality in the flow. Building of the methodology is explained with a simple example. Then the methodology is applied to multiple designs, including Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to verify its applicability.},

  abstract = {
	  Specifications and implementations of complex physical systems tend to
	  differ as low level effects such as sampling are often ignored when
	  high level models are created. Thus, the low level models are often
	  not exact refinements of the high level specification. However, they
	  are similar to those. To bridge the gap between those models, we
	  study robust simulation relations for hybrid systems. We identify a
	  family of robust simulation relations that allow for certain bounded
	  deviations in the behavior of a system specification and its
	  implementation in both values of the system variables and timings. We
	  show that for this relaxed version of simulation a broad class of
	  logical properties is preserved. The question whether two systems are
	  in simulation relation can be reduced to a reach avoid problem for
	  hybrid games. We provide a sufficient condition under which a winning
	  strategy for these games exists.}

abstract={This technical note studies quantitatively asymptotic growth behaviors of trajectories (AGBT) of nonlinear autonomous discrete dynamical system that has unbounded domain, non-Lipschitz continuous nonlinear operator, and stable or unstable equilibrium point. We explain how trajectory motion speed is quantitatively determined in the system, and study exact computation and sharp estimation of the smallest exponential bound of trajectories. We characterize exponential stability and asymptotic stability of the system from a new point of view, and provide a simple condition to distinguish them from each other. These results extend existing results that were obtained in some special cases of the system, and are helpful for quantitative analysis and understanding of AGBT of the system.},
